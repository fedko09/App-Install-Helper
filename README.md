# App-Install-Helper
MicroDeploy Toolbox is a Windows deployment GUI for installing, updating, and uninstalling apps using Winget or Chocolatey. Includes profiles, runtime detection, cleanup automation, progress overlay, and JSON-based presets for fast, repeatable system setup.

PS1 and EXE are the same app, just different execution. Use as see fit. 

> With PS1 file, drop the file in a location, open terminal/powershell, navigate to the directory, use **Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass** to remove script prompt, and then type in the .\MicroDeploy-Toolbox.ps1 and enter. Execution policy will reset with close/reopen of terminal window.
